# pokedex
This is a full CRUD django app for finding and catching pokemon

After cloning repo, run `py manage.py runserver` from /pokedex (or `py -u manage.py runserver` for debugging to see print("hello world") calls)

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/pokedex/

From here you can:
1. Catch some pokemon using the button at the bottom of the screen
2. See the pokemon you've already caught by clicking the link at the top of the page.  Here you can rename or release your pokemon.
3. Become the very best that no one ever was
